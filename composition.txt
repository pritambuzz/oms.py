Thank you very much for your time today to discuss about the position with Crypto. I appreciate the opportunity to learn more about this job.

With regards to the oppertunity shared I find the technology related to using Crypto fascinating and an amazing opportunity for the future, but security is also a major concern. Keeping Crypto Company's information safe would be a top priority for the person in this job, and I would love to dig deeply into the protective technologies.

As we discussed, I have 10 Years of experience with Core Java, Python, NodeJS as backend along with Frontend frameworks such as Angular, also based on my previous experience I am very much enthusiastic to learn and leverage my skills for emerging distributed technology w.r.t blockchain and cryptocurrency. To elaborate more about my enthusiasm in cryptocurrency exchange I have been doing POC on this, to demonstrate I have attached my POC document. Kindly feel free to have more discussion on the document shared.

With my background and experience, I believe that I could become a contributor to team very quickly.
